Find all directories in current folder:
	Including hidden folders - 18:		find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | wc -l
	just the GitHub project  - 16: 		find . -mindepth 1 -maxdepth 1 -type d | grep -v '^\./\.' |wc -l
						another option: ls -l | grep  '^d' | wc -l

going forward - I'll include all directories and files including .git<something>
